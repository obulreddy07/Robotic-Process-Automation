Conditional Salaries Increment System
🛠️Automation Anywhere Task:
Today, I built a simple yet impactful automation using Automation Anywhere that demonstrates how RPA can streamline decision-making and data updates in Excel workbooks.

🔹Workflow Highlights:
-Read employee data directly from an Excel workbook.
-Applied conditional logic to determine salary raises based on company and salary thresholds.
-Wrote updated salary information back into the same workbook.

📊 Business Rules Implemented:
(Nanotech) → Employees earning < $40,000 receive a 10% raise, others receive 5%
(Picotech) → Employees earning < $40,000 receive a 15% raise, others receive 10%
(Microtech) → All employees receive a 5% raise.

This task reflects how RPA can automate repetitive decision-making processes, reduce manual effort, and ensure accuracy in business workflows.

"Excited to keep building more automation solutions that bridge business logic with efficiency.
